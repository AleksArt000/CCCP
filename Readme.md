the [CCCP](https://github.com/Soviet-Linux/CCCP) package manager (CCCP Crafter of Controlled Packages), uses either installer binaries produced with the â€”create argument or sources from a .spm (soviet package manager) file. 


Here is a list of the parameters that may be used with the CCCP.:
1. --install (installs a .spm files)

1. --remove (removes a package)

    "version" : "<version>",
    "dependencies" : ["<a dependencie>","<other dependencie>"],
    "info" : 
    {
        "download" : "<download command>",
